"""
Pseudocode for pile of cubes using threads and queues:

# import modules queue and thread
# function 'read_input' that takes a queue as an argument
# read the number of test cases
# put the number of test cases in the queue
# same as the code
# #ut the 'side_lengths' list in the queue
# function 'process_input' that takes a queue as an argument
# while the queue is not empty
# get the next data from the queue
# same as the code
# define the function 'pile_of_cubes' that initializes the queue and creates two threads
# a 'reader' thread that runs the 'read_input' function
# a 'processor' thread that runs the 'process_input' function
# start both threads and wait for the 'reader' thread to complete
# put a "STOP" signal in the queue to terminate the 'processor' thread and wait for it to complete."""
